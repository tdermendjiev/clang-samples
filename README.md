This project shows the different behavior of the Clang RecursiveASTVisitor in two versions of LLVM(4.0.1 and 7.0.0).

The two patches are automatically applied in order to log the total number of declarations being visited by the tool.

To generate the Xcode projects run **setup.sh**.

To clean all downloaded files and the build folders run **clean.sh**.
